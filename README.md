## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

## My process

I really don't think I have one yet?  Write up the HTML, do the CSS, struggle, Google, scratch my head, struggle some more.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### What I learned

Learned how to use flexbox better and having to put stuff where its supposed to go on my own rather than relying on tutorials. Still not 100% confident in my abilities, but I'm getting there.  I know there are better ways of doing things, but for the moment I'm just trying to pass the damn challenge :D

### Continued development

I still want to focus more on flexbox, grid, and positioning things better.  Probably should learn how to do my HTML structure better as well (someone online mentioned semantics?).

### Useful resources

Pretty much Google, and a little help from Frontend Mentor.
